# Glyphify: multipurpose Glyph app
## Introduction
**Glyphify** is an **Android app made for Nothing Phones**, it **packs multiple features to make the Glyph interface more useful**:

### Glyphifier
It's an automatic composer, choose any song (.mp3, wav etc) and it will be converted into a Glyph synched ringtone with a better accuracy compared to the built-in Nothing algorithm. Phone(2) users can also enjoy all 33 zones addressing for their ringtones. Songs are also randomic, meaning that by using the same source file you will get a different ringtone each time, choose which one you like the most!

### Extended Nothing Essential notifications
Why use only one Glyph as an Essential notification LED? With Glyphify you can map any Glyph zone to any of your contact and also chose between two different light effect on a per zone basis: static and pulsing light

## Compatibility
The app has been tested on Nothing Phone(1), Phone(2) and Phone(2a).

## BETA features usage:
The following features will be in BETA until Nothing give's an API key, for both of these to work you first need to go into developer settings and activate `Glyph Interface debug mode`
- Phone(2a)'s battery indicator: set Glyphify to `Unrestricted` battery usage (this is will prevent Android from killing the foreground service) and **leave the app opened when you want to use this feature**. When you plug the power, the phone is laying horizontal and you wiggle it you will see the battery indicator.
- Extended Nothing Essential notifications: go into the `Notifications` tab on the app, grant the permissions and select the zones you are interested in
