# Glyphify: multipurpose Glyph app
[Deutsch](./README_DE.md) | [日本語](./README_JA.md)
## Introduction
**Glyphify** is an **Android app made for Nothing Phones**, it **packs multiple features to make the Glyph interface more useful**:

### Glyphifier
It's an automatic composer, choose any song (.mp3, wav etc) and it will be converted into a Glyph synched ringtone with a better accuracy compared to the built-in Nothing algorithm. Phone(2) users can also enjoy all 33 zones addressing for their ringtones. Songs are also randomic, meaning that by using the same source file you will get a different ringtone each time, choose which one you like the most!

### Extended Nothing Essential notifications
Why use only one Glyph as an Essential notification LED? With Glyphify you can **map any Glyph zone to multiple contacts and apps** and also chose between two different light effect on a per zone basis: static and pulsing glyph
